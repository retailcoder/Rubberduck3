# Rubberduck.UI.Shared

This namespace defines user interface elements and services that are _shared_ between RD3 applications.

For example the `About` and `Settings` dialogs may be shown from the add-in, or from the editor, or even another future application.

**Do not put UI elements and services here that are specific to a particular application**.
